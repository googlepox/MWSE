This event fires when a particular mod's configuration menu has been closed. This happens when the MCM is closed or when a different mod's configuration menu was opened.

You can use this event to update your mod whenever its MCM is closed. This event may also be useful if you're trying to make your mod compatible with another mod, as it lets you detect whenever that mod updates its settings.

```lua
--- @param e modConfigEntryClosedEventData
local function modConfigEntryClosedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.modConfigEntryClosed, modConfigEntryClosedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`modName`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `isFavorite` (boolean): *Read-only*. Whether that mod was a favorite.
