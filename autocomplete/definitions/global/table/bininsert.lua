If 'comp' is given, then it must be a function that receives two values in `t` and returns `true` when the first is less than the second.
i.e., `comp(a,b) == true` would mean `a` is less than `b`.

If you want to sort in reverse order, you may set `comp = function(a, b) return a > b end`.

This function will return the index where `value` was inserted into `t`.]],
