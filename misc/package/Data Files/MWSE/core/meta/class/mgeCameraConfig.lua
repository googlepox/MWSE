--- Allows control of MGE camera features.
--- @class mgeCameraConfig
--- @field fov number Horizontal FOV, in degrees.
--- @field nearRenderDistance number The active world render distance in world units. This is the non-distant part that Morrowind simulates. Reducing this distance will affect the visible actor range and full detail world rendering, in exchange for better performance. This value is limited to between 2500-7168 units, and defaults to 7168 units.
--- @field shakeAcceleration number Camera shake acceleration. Camera shake must be enabled to see an effect.
--- @field shakeEnable boolean Set if camera shake is active.
--- @field shakeMagnitude number Camera shake magnitude. Camera shake must be enabled to see an effect.
--- @field thirdPersonOffset tes3vector3 The position offset (from the character) of the third person camera.
--- @field zoom number Camera zoom multiplier. Default is 1.0. Camera zoom must be enabled to see an effect.
--- @field zoomEnable boolean Set if camera zoom is enabled.

function mgeCameraConfig.stopZoom() end

--- Sets up continuous camera zoom. The zoom speed starts at `rate`. The speed will approach `targetRate` over time, if provided.
